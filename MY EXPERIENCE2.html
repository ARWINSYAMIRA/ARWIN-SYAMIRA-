  <h1>EXPERIENCE DURING LOCKDOWN AS A STUDENT</h1>
</header>

<div class="w3-container">
  <p>During the lockdown, there are many things that change and of course those things give a positive and negative effect to me and to those who are students. Among the things that have changed is online learning. At first, I struggled to cope with online learning. But, when I have been faced with this situation for a long time, it gave me positive feedback that I am better at managing my work schedule in a more orderly manner.</p>

  <h1>EXPERIENCE DOING BUSINESS AS A STUDENT</h1>
</header>

<div class="w3-container">
  <p>Starting a business is a fun thing to do. However, running a business at the same time while being a student is not an easy thing to handle. Based on my experience, when I ran a business when I was a student, I was able to divide my time between studying and business well. By doing this business as well, I get an income that can cover my life.</p>
